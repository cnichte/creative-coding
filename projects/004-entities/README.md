## Description

This is a graphic thought experiment on the subject of the individual and society. 

Wikipedia [says...](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entit√§t)

* On the one hand, an entity denotes something that exists, a being, a concrete or abstract object. In this sense, the term entity is usually used as a collective term to address such diverse objects as things, properties, relations, states of affairs or events all at once. This is the common usage in contemporary language.
* On the other hand, an entity can also stand for the essence of an object in the sense of an element necessary for the existence and identity of the object. In this respect, entity is related in meaning to the classical concept of substance.

The name-giving entity is thus a precisely delimitable individual specimen. Our individual is subject to rules, like every individual in our society... ... that is the basic idea. 

This is all still work in progress... ...so it will be continued.
