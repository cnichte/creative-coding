## Description

Today, we stare a lot at the screens of our computers. These screens are made up of countless densely packed pixels that we perceive collectively as images. The Grid enlarges and coarsens this structure, and plays around with it, for example by breaking the grid and manipulating the contents of the grid in different ways. 

So 'The Grid' is a creative game with minimalist geometric shapes on a grid. Here you can let off steam yourself, and save the result as a printable graphic in the Export / Import tab. You have several basic shapes to choose from. You can freely determine the size of the shapes, the thickness of the lines, you can set a random accent, and much more. I started the project in spring 2022, and it is still "work in progress".

Have fun
